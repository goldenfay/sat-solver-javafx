# 3-SAT problem solver in Java

A multi-method SAT solver based on JavaFX, using Classique and heuristic searchs.


# Methods
the application uses both classic search and metaheuristic methods.
  - #### Classic methods:
    -  DFS,BFS searchs.
    -  Greedy search.
    -  A* search.
  - #### Meta-heuristic methods:
    - Genetic algorithm (GA).
    - PSO algorithm.
    - BSO algorithm.
    - ACO algorithm.
    
# Features
